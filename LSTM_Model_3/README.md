This map contains the same model twice, except one has been trained longer and with significantly more data than the other. 

There is also a Jupyter Notebook, which is set up in a way that you can easily run all the cells and see the results of both models after.

The CSV file contains all of the quotes used during training and is also neccesary at the moment to create quotes (the tokenizer has to be initialized based on the quotes). 
The map wordLists contains some text files that help create and filter quotes.
