Here I did some quick filtering and analysis of the dataset we started out with.

We start out with 76k quotes, but after accounting for duplicates we are left with ~61k quotes. We can also see that there are 117 unique genres, and for each we can see how often they occur.
It becomes obvious pretty quickly that some genres should probably be deleted, for example "saintpatricksday".
